# DEVOPS - TP1: Docker

## Objectives

- Create a GitHub repository named after your EFREI identifier.
- Develop a wrapper that retrieves the weather for a given location using its latitude and longitude (passed as environment variables), utilizing the OpenWeather API. You may use the programming language of your choice (bash, python, go, nodejs, etc.).
- Package your code in a Docker image.
- Publish your Docker image on DockerHub.
- Make your code accessible in a GitHub repository.

## Deliverables

1. Public GitHub repository URL containing the Dockerfile and wrapper code.
2. Public DockerHub registry URL where your Docker image is hosted.
3. A report detailing your technical choices, commands used, and challenges faced if the task wasn't completed. This report should be emailed no later than 48 hours after the TP ends to the professor's email with the subject: `[TP1-DEVOPS] LAST NAME FIRST NAME`.

## Grading Criteria

- Code availability on GitHub.
- A Dockerfile that successfully builds.
- Docker image availability on DockerHub.
- Functionality of the API, verifiable by running the following command with your Docker image:

docker run --env LAT="31.2504" --env LONG="-99.2506" --env API_KEY=****yourregistry/api:1.0.0


## Bonus Points

Earn bonus points for:

- No CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) as reported by `trivy`:

trivy image yourregistry/api:1.0.0

- No lint errors in the Dockerfile as reported by `hadolint`:

docker run --rm -i hadolint/hadolint < Dockerfile

- Ensuring no sensitive data (e.g., OpenWeather API key) is stored within the image.
